# audioscrubber
A simple application designed for scrubbing through long audio files. 

Essentially, open the application, swipe in from the left, tap "Select file" and select an audio file you'd like to listen to. The audio clip should start playing automatically. The fast forward button will skip forward 30 seconds, and the rewind button will rewind 5 seconds. You may also scrub using the progress bar above these buttons.

This is an Android Studio project.
